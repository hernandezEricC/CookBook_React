# My Cook Book

## Problem Statement
Too long have I wondered what to cook throughout the week. Coming up with a ideas to feed my family for every meal, everyday of the week is a chore. Not to mention formulating a shopping list to go along with weekly meals adds to the stress and unfortunately not having a game plan when you go to the grocery store, leads to waste and can be costly. 

The recipe app takes on the burden of meal planning by allowing users to store recipes, plan meals and generate shopping list based on meals selected for any given week. The recipe app will reduce the amount of food waste and save you money.

Iâ€™m using this project to strengthen my full stack development skills, with a particular focus on using React as the front-end library.
